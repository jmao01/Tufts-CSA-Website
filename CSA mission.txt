Our Mission

Tufts Chinese Students Association is one of the largest cultural organizations on the Tufts campus. We welcome everyone and anyone, you don't have to be Chinese or from Tufts. Our organization hopes to be a link for students to get to know each other and experience Chinese culture at the same time.
