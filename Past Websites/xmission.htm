                                      the Chinese Students Association. To achieve 
                                      and maintain an active member status, a

                                      Section 8: Replacement Policy: The elected 
                                      officers will nominate and appoint replacement 
                                      officers for vacant spots. Should the President 
                                      position be vacant, the Vice President is 
                                      given the first right to that position. 
                                      Should he/she decide not to take it, then 
                                      the position opens up for the other officers. 
                                      If no officer runs for the position, then 
                                      it will be open for officers to nominate 
                                      any non-officer members of the club. The 
                                      same hierarchy applies to the Vice President 
                                      position. <br>
